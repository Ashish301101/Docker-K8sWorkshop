# Docker-K8s Workshop
Repository for the hands on workshop on Docker and Kubernetes.

It is more docker, less K8s because we want to do a deep dive and leave you with something meaningful! I have added extensive readme.md to help you navigate and understand every bit.

Divided into 3 phases :

1. Containerization
2. Orchestration
3. Scaling

Incase of queries, feel free to ask up!
